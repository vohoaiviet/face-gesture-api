# The Face Gesture API Project #
The topic of this project is a basic research considering a human-computer interaction. It describes a head gesture controlled system put into effect.

The project presents an approach to control applications with head movements. The system is still under construction and based on facial features tracking and head pose estimation.

We construct an Active Appearance Model (AAM) for facial feature extraction. Based on the landmarks of AAM shape, the head pose is modeled in the three-dimensional space by three Euler angles of rotation around the three axes orthogonal to each other, and three orthogonal translation directions.

Regarding all the above mentioned facts, the system is capable of recognizing the fol-lowing gestures: head pointing, nodding, and shaking.
